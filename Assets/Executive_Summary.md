## Problem Statement

What attributes of colleges contribute to an increased probability that the campus will see greater than 5% of the student population infected with the Coronavirus?

## Target Variable
Target Column: Predict a University's classification into **greater_than_5**, which indicates whether a college has case counts that exceed 5% of the total enrolled population


---
## Exploratory Data analysis
During exploratory analysis of the dataset we found several notable features that had strong correlations to case counts and our target column 'greater_than_five.' The most strongly correlated column contained data about the number of freshman students submitting ACT scores as part of their admissions process . The ACT tends to be used more often in the middle section of the United States, this regionalization may be influencing the correlation ([source](https://www.collegeraptor.com/getting-in/articles/act-sat/preference-act-sat-state-infographic/)).

Total enrollment correlated strongly with the overall case count, but not as strongly with the engineered columns were used to control for overall school size. That said, freshman enrollment did have a small but relatively strong relationship with the target column 'greater_than_five' suggesting that where schools enrolled a large freshman class, case counts may see increases overall.

Other notable features include engineered features created with the categorical features included in the initial dataset. The second most correlated feature after processing the categorical features was engineered using a class plan column indicating colleges would primarily have courses in person and a column indicating state had reopened bars, we labeled this feature 'packed_bars.' This indicates that colleges that were planning to have in-person classes in a state where bars were reopened in mid-August saw higher infection rates overall. The two heatmaps included below show the top positive and negative correlations between the features and the target variable 'greater_than_five,' indicting a college has had cases exceeding 5% of the total enrollment.

## Modeling

To model and predict which colleges would have outbreaks, we explored several classification models, including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression models, and Neural nets. Ultimately we found that the Logistic Regression model performed the best on our data. The final model produced a training score of 0.8, as well as a 0.8 testing score. While this was not incredibly far from our baseline of 0.76, we felt this illustrates part of the challenge of working with Public Health Data, especially in a time where the world faces an unprecedented global disaster.

To begin, we ran several models at once with default parameters to help decide which models to focus on refining. The scores for the initial models are below:

|Model|Best Score|
|---|---|
|LogisticRegression() |0.7485714285714286|
|KNeighborsClassifier()|0.6228571428571429|
|DecisionTreeClassifier()|0.7142857142857143|
|BaggingClassifier()|0.7771428571428571|
|RandomForestClassifier()|0.7771428571428571|
|AdaBoostClassifier()|0.8057142857142857|
|SVC()|0.7485714285714286|

We proceeded with refining the Random Forest, Adaboost, and Logistic Regression along with a Neural Net in an effort to increase our scores. We found that the Linear Regression performed well and was the least overfit of our models with a training and testing score of 0.8 and 0.8 respectively when we included all 135 features created after converting the categorical features to numeric features. To help create a more streamlined model, we chose to remove some of the low frequency features around the football conferences to reduce the input dataframe to only 43 features in total. This increased our Training score to 0.82, but was slightly more overfit with a test score of 0.79.

For our final production model we would choose the Logistic Regression with all 135 features, which performed slightly over our baseline of 0.75.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
From our data we found that largely, the probability for colleges to avoid or prevent Coronavirus infections depends on the policies set by the state and surrounding states. One advantage of the Logistic Regression model is the interpretability of coefficients. Analyzing the top ten coefficients, we found that the number of freshman submitting act scores continued to be related to the colleges coronavirus infections. Additionally we see the class_plan feature indicating which schools decided to have primarily in-person classes as number 2 on the list. This indicates that if an institution's class plan is primarily in person, the institution is ~1.147 times as likely to have a significant amount of Coronavirus cases, all else held constant.  

We recognize that our model performs just slightly above baseline, and so given the huge number of variables that affect public health, one direction we would explore would be to gather additional data. While we hoped to identify admission data that can help colleges make decisions about their own risk, overall we found that the regional features largely overshadowed them. Additionally, we would be interested in adding a Time Series analysis to help inform how the Coronavirus cases changed as state policies updated over the course of the semester.

That said, we recommend that for colleges hoping to avoid Coronavirus infections, they closely look at their state's policies and the surrounding state's policies.
